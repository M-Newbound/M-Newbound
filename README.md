### 👋 About Me 
I'm Martin, a current student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Outside of university, I'm working on sharpening my skills in C++, machine learning, and more. I use GitHub for my own personal projects and to share my acidemic assigments.

### 🛠️ Current Focus
I'm deep into the world of chess, crafting my own chess engine from scratch using C++. It's not just about moves and strategies; it's a journey into algorithmic thinking and the beauty of the game. Check out my Chess Engine Repository to follow the development and maybe even contribute your insights!

### 🤖 Exploring Machine Learning
I'm delving into the realms of machine learning. Excited about the possibilities it holds, I'm currently learning and experimenting with ML concepts, algorithms, and frameworks. Stay tuned for future projects that build on these concepts.
